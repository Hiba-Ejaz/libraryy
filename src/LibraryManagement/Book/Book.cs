//Book has properties like Title, Author, 
//ISBN, PublicationYear, CanBorrow, and CanPrint. 
//To simplify the logic, we can consider each book an unique record with unique ISBN
// in the Library. 
//In addition, Book has PrintInfo() method to print information about each book (uses Console.WriteLine).
// Comic, Novel, TextBook, and ResearchPaper should inherit properties from Book
// and have additional properties/features:
// Comic has Artist, Novel has Genre
// Comic, Novel, TextBook can be borrowed, but ResearchPaper cannot.
// If books are borrowable, they should have both Borrow() and Return() method
// TextBook, and ResearchPaper can be printed (to certain amount of pages),
// but Comic, Novel cannot.
// The PrintPages(int startPage, endPage)method uses Console.WriteLine to inform 
//the start page and end page to be printed, in case the amount of to-be-printed pages
// do not exceed the maximum allowed pages.
// Comicand Novel should have different implementations of PrintInfo() with extra 
//information about the extra properties, while TextBook, and ResearchPaper
// have default implementation.
